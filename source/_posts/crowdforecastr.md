[Crowdforecastr](https://crowdforecastr.org) is a web app developed to elicit time series predictions of infectious diseases from human participants. 

The [app](http://app.crowdforecastr.org) is currently used to predict reported cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Europe (with a focus on the UK and previously on Germany and Poland). Predictions are aggregated and submitted to the [European Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/) every week. 

The app is written as an R shiny app and the [code](https://github.com/epiforecasts/crowdforecastr) is bundled together as an R pacakge, crowdforecastr, that is freely available for everyone to use.
